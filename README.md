Hello!
I am Alexandra Boyko, the pwner of this repository. I wish I couls be good in Bioinformatics, so I try to learn some necessary skills such as GitHub.
Now I am starting to study how to use SQL and SQL-based languages. 
It will be very useful and simply it's required for pur project at LUMC (Leiden, Netherlands).
